<p>I was standing just behind the driver's seat. Just after 10 min. A lady came near the front gate to get down at her stop with her child (really cute one) of around 5 to 6 years. The lady was looking little worried as, it was heavily raining. As the stop was coming near by. She was restlessly looking out at the heavy rain and then towards her child. The lady was getting more worried. When she was about to get down with her child in the heavy rain. An aged gentleman beside me offered her an umbrella. The lady resisted to take a favour from stranger. But the words of gentleman removed the hesitation of the lady. The gentleman told "See ma'am yesterday, when I was getting wet a stranger man handed it to me and told 'Use it now, and then pass it on to some needy'. So I am just passing on the fortune which I got yesterday to you. So please accept it do the same 'Use it now, and then pass it to some needy'". The lady happily accepted the umbrella and assured to maintain the chain.  After chatting with him for some more time. I came to know. He always buy 3 - 4 extra umbrella in every monsoon from last 20 years and give it to the needy like this. This act of him really touched me and thought that with people like him around us. World would be a better place to live in.</p>                </article>
